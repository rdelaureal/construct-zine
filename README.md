# de-struct

#### video demo:  <URL HERE>

#### description

**de-struct** is a blog created by Ryan de Laureal using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), inspired by the perspectives of the [Situationist International](https://monoskop.org/Situationist_International) as well as the design principles of the [Bauhaus](https://monoskop.org/Bauhaus), [Constructivism](https://monoskop.org/Constructivism), and other art movements of 20th century.

Jekyll is written in Ruby and makes use of the Liquid templating language. **de-struct**'s design modifies and builds upon Minima, Jekyll's base theme, using HTML, Liquid, CSS, and Sass. The files within the *_includes* and *_layouts* folders overwrite Minima's default HTML templates, while *assets/main.scss* modifies the default styling, creating **de-struct**'s unique theme. New original posts are added to the *_posts* directory.

The site's main settings are configured in *_config.yml* and Jekyll's Ruby gems are set in the *Gemfile*.

When the site is deployed, the Liquid and Sass templates are converted to HTML and CSS, and copied to the *_site* directory, which hosts the site.
