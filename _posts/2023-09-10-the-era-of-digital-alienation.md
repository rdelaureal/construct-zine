They've gotten us addicted to posts, to likes, to memes, to stupid little videos, the feed they call it, and we are the livestock for this existential junk food of digital ephemera seasoned with ads, consumed and then immediately forgotten, superseded by the newest content, new disjointed shreds of thought and feeling and language and image and experience, the commodified remains of our former lives once lived out in real time and in real places with real people, now nothing but bundles of data owned by them, sold at a profit, bought for nothing, not even bought, but traded freely by us for the latest apps and networks and platforms and games and gadgets and gizmos. This data is the apex, the crown jewel of this economy of consumerist capitalism: it is the ultimate commodity, the profile that they are creating of us, that we have created of ourselves, not realizing that it was really for them, this ghostly negative, this silouhette from which they mine our thoughts, our dreams, our feelings, our needs and desires, in order to influence our actions, to guide us back to them, so that we expend our paltry wages on their products, reinforcing their power, greasing the wheels of their system, the system which locks us in its seemingly inescapable grip. All the while our health declines and anxiety and isolation and unhappiness grow and we wonder why, so they get us hooked on treatments, on remedies, on upgrades bundled with subscriptions, they convince us that we must try harder, that we must improve ourselves so as to better serve them, that we may acquire more money to spend so that they continue to profit, and now they are trying to convince us that it does not matter anyway, that the world is not real, that our reality is nothing but a simulation, that way we will no longer care what happens to it, we will no longer care that they are destroying it, we will no longer care what they have done to us, what they are doing to us, what they do to us daily, with increasing frequency, every second of every hour.

The novelty is beginning to wear off, but in an economy of novelty this cannot be allowed, there must be always something new queueing up to replace the old. This spectacle cannot stop, it must continually replenish, repackage, reinvent, regurgitate. This it does under the banner of "innovation", that ideology which deifies all that is new, even if it is simply the old under a new label, even if it is worse than what came before.
